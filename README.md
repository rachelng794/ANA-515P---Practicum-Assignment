# ANA-515P---Practicum-Assignment
Student Name: Hai Yen Nguyen.

The chosen project and dataset:  Mental Health in Tech.

In the file survey.xlsx, I combined 2 original worksheets into one to have an overview of the dataset.

I used R to retrieve, load, and clean the data. 
I also found and fixed errors in the data.
Visualizations were embedded to aid in my identification of errors.
